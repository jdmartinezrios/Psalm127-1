    "introPsalm": "It is easy to see why Jesus had to be a carpenter. His Father loved to build, and demonstrated His magnificent blue-collar attributes in three major projects. The first was what many mistakenly call Noah’s Ark… it was actually God’s. The divine instructions were detailed and Noah followed them perfectly, and in so doing provided everything that was necessary for the remnant of God’s creation to be saved as He judged everybody and everything else. The second was the Tent of Meeting. Once again, God’s heavenly anointed craftsmen followed God’s amazingly specific plans to produce a mobile sanctuary for men to meet and interact with God. The third and final earthly structure was His temple. From the foundation to the finishing trim, Solomon duplicated the explicit blueprints drawn by the Almighty Architect Himself.",
